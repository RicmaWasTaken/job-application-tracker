Job Tracker in an online app designed to help job-seekers by keeping track of their applications and leads. 

It offers valuable insight, by creating helpful statistics on the user's activity on a given period (weekly, monthly or all-time). Job Tracker's dynamic "callback" feature invites the user to call a company back if the application has remained un-updated after a custom period. 

This is a personal project that will be made available online after its completion.
